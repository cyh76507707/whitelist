# Steemhunt Whitelist and Blacklist

## Whitelist

Steemhunt whitelist entails users whose user score is at least 1.0 or above. The user score is decided by the following formula:
```
Score = Credibility Score *  Activity Score * Curation Score * Hunter Score
```

1. Credibility Score
This score means how much the account is trustworthy. It is calculated by combining:
  a. Steem reputation
  b. Steem power
  c. Account age from signing up Steemhunt
  d. [Buildawhale blacklist](https://github.com/themarkymark-steem/buildawhaleblacklist) - an external blacklisted user database

2. Activity Score
It shows how much the user actively uses Steemhunt.

3. Curation Score
This reflects how well the user upvotes hunting posts in an adding-value way. It can be increased or decreased whether the user:
  a. Are considered to be in the circle voters (voting ring)
  b. Upvote many different users (diversity score)

4. Hunter Score
This score represents how much the user has posted valuable hunts. It is calculated based on:
  a. Average ranks of his/her hunt post
  b. Penalty point when his/her hunt post got de-listed by our community moderators.  

## Blacklist
We blacklist users for 30 days if the user attempt the following actions:

1. Operate many alternative accounts to disrupt Steemhunt voting pool and its ranking chart
